# Onslaught Overdrive
Repository for 255 Proj

This group project was created for CGT 255 at Purdue University.
Onslaught Overdrive is a top down arcade-style shooter made in Unreal Engine 5.
This game combines my love of fast-paced top down shooter games similar to The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon with my deep interest in guitar pedals.
